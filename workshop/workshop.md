Hello again everyone,

Now that we've laid the groundwork for understanding React and the concepts of component-based architecture, it's time to put that knowledge into practice. In this coding portion of our workshop, we'll get our hands dirty with some actual coding.

Here's what we'll be doing:

Setting Up Our Environment: We'll start by downloading and installing Create React App, an officially supported way to start a new React single-page application. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.

Installing Additional Libraries: We'll install React Router, a standard library for routing in React, which will allow us to create multiple pages in our application. We'll also add Material UI, a popular component library that implements Google's Material Design.

Creating a File Structure: A good file structure can make your project easy to navigate and maintain. We'll set up a simple, intuitive file structure for our application that promotes best practices.

Creating Shared Components: We'll develop a few shared components, such as a Header and a Footer, which can be reused across different pages of our application. This will give you a firsthand look at how component reusability works in React.

Remember, learning to code is a hands-on process, and the best way to learn is by doing. Don't worry if you make mistakesâ€”every mistake is a learning opportunity. Let's get started!

As we conclude our coding session, we'll add an exciting touch to our application - we're going to incorporate a Material UI theme reflecting our branding. Not only will this make our app look professional and on-brand, it will also give you a glimpse into advanced UI configuration.

With Material UI's powerful theming capabilities, we can customize our application's appearance to align with any design guidelines or branding requirements. This is an important skill in the real-world where brand consistency across applications is often a requirement.

We hope this workshop has provided you with a strong introduction to React and the broader concepts of frontend development. The journey doesn't stop here, though. Use the resources we've provided and continue exploring. Experiment with new libraries, build your own projects, and keep learning.
