# Workshop Series: From Design to Development for Designers & UX Practitioners

Hello there! I'm Jeffrey, and welcome to our workshop series, "From Design to Development for Designers & UX Practitioners." This open-source workshop series is designed to help bridge the gap between UX design and modern Node-based development. Our goal is to provide designers and UX practitioners with the skills needed to work seamlessly with components and code.

## About this Workshop Series

This series consists of three sessions, each designed to build upon the previous one, ensuring you gain the foundational knowledge and hands-on experience needed to work effectively in a development environment.

In this workshop series, we'll cover:

### Session 1: Getting Started with Development

- Foundations to the terminal and file system navigation
- Setting up VS Code and discussing what a code editor is
- Installing Node
- Creating a React application using Create React App
- Adding and using Material UI (MUI) components

### Session 2: Building Your Application

- Demistifying Node projects
- Setting up routes and pages in React
- Using more advanced MUI components
- Foundations to Git for version control
- Hands-on exercises to solidify concepts

### Session 3: Working in Your Codebase

- Foundations to Node and Node commands
- Integrating knowledge into your own projects
- Final project walkthrough and Q&A

## Using this Workshop Series

Encourage participants to follow along with practical examples and actively participate in exercises. This hands-on approach will help them gain a deeper understanding of the concepts.

The goal is not only to equip participants with the skills needed for their current projects but also to provide a solid foundation for future projects. By understanding the starting point and evolution of their projects, participants will be better prepared to adapt to new tools and frameworks.

## Contribute Back

This workshop series is freely available, and contributions to improve and expand upon it are highly appreciated. Whether it's a typo fix, content enhancement, or new concept suggestion, your contributions help improve the workshop for the entire community. The stronger our collective knowledge, the more robust and versatile our teams and projects become!

## Feedback is Crucial

Your feedback is invaluable in refining this workshop series and shaping future ones. Whether it's from you or from those you are instructing, please share all comments, suggestions, and ideas. Your feedback helps me understand what works well and where there's room for improvement.
