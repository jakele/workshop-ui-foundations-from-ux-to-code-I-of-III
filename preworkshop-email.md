I hope you're as excited as I am about our upcoming workshop series, "From Design to Development for Designers & UX Practitioners"! As we prepare to dive into this hands-on learning experience, I wanted to share some important information and steps you can take to ensure you're ready for our first session.

### Workshop Overview

In this workshop series, we'll cover:

- Introduction to the terminal and file system navigation
- Setting up VS Code and discussing what a code editor is
- Creating a React application using Create React App
- Adding and using Material UI (MUI) components

### Preparation Steps

Before our first session, please make sure you have the following set up:

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

   - Download and install VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Terminal (for Mac users)**

   - Ensure you can open and use the terminal on your Mac. If you're new to the terminal, here is a [quick guide](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac).

3. **Windows Users**
   - If you're using a Windows machine, please reach out to me prior to the workshop so we can ensure your setup is ready for the workshop exercises.

### Additional Resources

Here are some links to resources we'll be using during the workshop:
