Subject: Welcome to the UI & React Foundations Workshop

Dear Team,

I'm thrilled to welcome you to the UI & React Foundations Workshop, a hands-on interactive learning experience designed to deepen your knowledge and skills in building modern web applications using React and other modern UI frameworks.

This workshop is a key part of our shared mission to continually develop and refine our technical skills, keeping us at the forefront of innovative solutions. It's an opportunity to explore React's component-based architecture, dive into some practical coding, and understand how React fits into the larger ecosystem of UI development.

Over the course of our session, we will:

- Download and install React from the Create React App project
- Set up routing and install Material UI
- Develop a simple file structure and shared components
- Pull in a Material UI theme for a polished, branded look

To maximize the value of our time together, I'd like to encourage you to install and run the Create React App before attending the workshop. This initial step will help us dive straight into the heart of our agenda. You can follow the official guide on [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) to get started. 

Remember, your engagement, curiosity, and preparation are vital for making the most of this learning experience. So, come ready, ask questions, and don't hesitate to share your thoughts.

Looking forward to our shared journey into the world of React and modern UI!

Cheers,
Jeffrey
